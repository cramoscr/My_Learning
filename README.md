# My_Learning
Programming exercises I did during my learning path.

As a programmer who started with Basic and Pascal, I am trying 
to keep current with new programming languages and software
development frameworks.

I will be mainly focused on mastering:
  - Python
  - Flutter
  - ReactJS

There are no promises, just a commitment to keep learning.

I will be producing two kind of files:
  a. Small exercises produced when attending the courses
  b. Projects with more complexity level

I hope this will inspire you on your own learning journey.

Carlos.
